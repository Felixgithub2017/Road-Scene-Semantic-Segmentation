Semantic Segmentation

There are two folders, the one for kitti contains all necessary python files and the predicted images. The model was trained for 60 epochs.

The one for cityscapes contains a jupyter notebook file, all the codes are run inside the notebook. The model was trained for 50 epochs. Predictions are made on all test images and on one of my own video.
